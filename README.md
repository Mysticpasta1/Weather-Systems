Weather Events

Acid Rain



Acid rain is a weather event that can be easily identified by its green tint. It can injure mobs, players, or animals occasionally, and destroy any sort of vegetation and turn grass coarse(essentially burning the soil).

Blizzard


Blizzards are a weather event that can be easily be identified by its fast moving snow, dense fog, and howling wind. It snows and freezes water rapidly and the snow can layer during these storms making the snow have varying height. When the event is over, the snow will begin to decay in areas that are not natively icy. Also slows players and other entities. Occurs across all biomes besides deserts(can configure to affect deserts).

Cloudy



Cloudy weather events darken the sky and lower the sun/moon/stars opacity(not fully) to make the sky give off a cloudy effect!

Light Rain



It's Minecraft Rain but well, lighter!
